Notebooks based on collections as data and Spanish text corpora.


## Ranking n-grams based on Spanish text corpora
This [example](Ranking-n-grams-based-on-Spanish-text-corpora.ipynb) is based on the dataset that provides text in computer readable format of the 2 books of the volume dedicated to the province of Avila of the Monumental Catalogue of Spain written by Manuel Gómez-Moreno (1900-1901). The dataset is available at [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Transcripci_n_del_Cat_logo_Monumental_de_Espa_a_Provincia_de_vila_por_Manuel_G_mez_Moreno_1900-1901_/12006318).

## Library of Congress & Chronicling America
This [notebook](Topic-Modeling-Chronicling-America-loc.ipynb) uses historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages provided by Chronicling America (ISSN 2475-2703). This example is based on the [About Hispano América](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87021178/) that was published in San Francisco.

## Topic modeling based on Spanish text corpora from the Hispanic Digital Library
The [Hispanic Digital Library](http://www.bne.es/en/Catalogos/BibliotecaDigitalHispanica/Acercade/) is the digital library of the Biblioteca Nacional de España. It provides access to thousands of digitised documents, including books printed from the 15th to the 20th century, manuscripts, drawings, engravings, pamphlets, posters, photographs, maps, atlases, music scores, historic newspapers and magazines and audio recordings.

This [example](Topic-Modeling-based-on-Spanish-text-corpora.ipynb) is based on the works of the author Manuel José Quintana since the library provides his works openly available as OCR output text.
